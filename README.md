## Authy Mongoid OAuth2 Provider 
This requires Mongoid.  This work is derivative work of https://github.com/Lelylan/rest-oauth2-server.   They had a full blown server install with some handling of ids that I didn't really like, so I stripped out most of the server stuff and put it into these files which you can download and put into your project.

### TODO
This really should be a gem.  If you're interested in helping me put this into a gem, fork and send over a pull request!
